            Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on the
            shores of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right mind
            would swim in the river, unless they grew up here, in which case
            they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot here, and
            the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring are are
            absolutely amazing.
          </p>

          <p class="place__text__paragraph">
            The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet
            architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If you're
            on the right bank of the Dnipro, the landscape is difficult to
            traverse for people on bikes and those wearing heels. The left bank
            is considered far less interesting and prestigious though, even by
            people who live on the far outskirts of the right one.

            The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town below from a
            rock that juts out into the sea. It is thought to have been built by
            Llewelyn the Great in the 13th century. Some 900 years later, the
            self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of Snowdonia has become a
            popular tourist destination during the summer months.

            A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the
            world's best ice cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient is
            rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another claim to fame is the
            fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom award for five years in a
            row for its spectacular floral displays around town. It was also
            home to David Lloyd George, the only Welshman ever to hold the
            office of Prime Minister of the UK.

            Berea is a small town located in the central part of Kentucky. The
            town is surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside. It's known
            as the arts and crafts capital of the state, and visitors will find
            plenty of shopping opportunities: shops with handmade jewelry,
            candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios, and more. The town
            holds a yearly festival celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish made
            with cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.

            However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea
            College was founded in 1855 and was the first college in the south
            to be racially integrated, as well as the first to be coeducational.
            Somewhat uniquely, it charges no tuition â€” every student receives a
            full-tuition scholarship.

            Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. In the kingdom era ,
            Muramvya was the royal capital and in 2007, because of its cultural
            and natural landscape, it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage
            Tentative List. It is located in the center of Burundi, between the
            country's political and economic capitals

            The weather is rather chilly at night, but during the day, you would
            think you're in heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft) above sea level,
            Mount Teza is one of the coldest places in the province. But that
            cool breeze allows for one of the largest plantations of tea and
            coffee in the country, which make up the bulk of Burundi's exports.

            The Kibira National Park, one of the largest wildlife reserves for
            apes, overlaps four provinces, including Muramvya. This National
            Park lies at the apex of the beautiful mountains of the Congo-Nile
            Divide, ranging between 1550 and 2660 meters of altitude. It is
            filled with beautiful vegetation, and a source for the various
            rivers and streams which provide water around the country.
